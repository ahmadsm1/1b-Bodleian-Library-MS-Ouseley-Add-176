    "description":"Ibrahim Sultan was a prince of the Timurid Dyansty who ruled over Shiraz, Iran from 1415 to his death in 1435. Grandson of Timur (Tamerlane), he was raised in Samarqand and found himself involved in disputes over succession of conquered land, eventually being appointed as the governor of Balkh at age 15. At the same time, his cousin Pir Muhammad was ruler of Shiraz in the Fars Province of Iran and was killed and subsequently replaced by his brother Iskander Sultan. After the new ruler declared his independence from the Timurid Empire, Ibrahim traveled to Shiraz to end the revolt and after much effort by his father Shahrukh to foil the rebels’ plans, Ibrahim Sultan became the ruler of Shiraz in 1415 (Abdullaeva 2008, 1).\n Ibrahim Sultan was known to be a great calligrapher and made the inscriptions on public buildings and personally wrote many copies of the Quran. He commissioned a work entitled the Zafarnama which detailed the conquests of his grandfather Timur (Abdullaeva 2008, 1). Many of the paintings in this work appear like those in the Shahnamah that he would also commission for himself, now known as the MS Ouseley Add. 176. We know he was the original patron of the manuscript as there is praise of him scattered throughout. This particular folio is an artist’s depiction of the Sultan’s majesty and authority over his empire."},

    "description":"These white flowers, in addition to the apple trees, roses, tulips and shrubs scattered all around the Sultan’s court are the artist’s attempt to both liven up the court and to make it more heaven-like (Gholipour 2016, 4). They also serve the more technical purpose of distracting the viewer’s eyes from the main subject of the folio, the grandeur of Ibrahim Sultan, in attempt to build up suspense for when he is finally ‘revealed’.\nThe artist has taken the liberty of painting the grass light blue instead of the usual green to make the sprawling vegetation stand out more, which would have otherwise blended into the environment given the 3D, almost aerial perspective of the painting.\nAn interesting thing to note is the resemblance of these flowers to that of a lotus plant, the national flower of Iran. It is also a frequently occurring element of Timurid wall paintings. Courts throughout the Timurid to the Safavid, from Samarkand to Isfahan, were abundantly populated with different flowers and fruit trees and this is not exception (Lentz 1993, 7). The fruit trees, more specifically apple tree in this painting, are a symbol of sweetness that is universally desired. As so many of these symbols are planted throughout the Sultan’s court, they become a subtle yet powerful device in enhancing the luxury and magnificence enjoyed by the Sultan."},

    "description":"Standing right beside the Sultan as he addresses the court are his advisors and other government officials, drawn at the same height as him but sandwiched together tightly in a packed crowd, with one of them holding his hands together across his waist indicating his servitude to the Sultan’s wishes. Of note here are the Timurid garments depicted in the painting, with much of their features matching earlier illustrations of Mongol clothing (Encyclopedia Iranica, n.d).\nThe men can be seen wearing a patterned belt across their waist called the qabā, worn over a long-sleeved tunic called a ‘qamiz’, though the qaba worn by the Mongols would be much more decorated. Everyone is wearing a turban, though each a different color. Most notably, the man closest to him is wearing an orange turban with a pointed block top, whereas everyone else’s has a flat top, except the Sultan’s pointed crown. Also like the Sultan, his robe, usually fur lined and ornamented at the bottom, is in stark contrast to the color of his qamiz, another trend from the Mongol era. Both of these two likenesses to the Sultan indicate the man’s closeness to him in rank as well, possibly making him the minister or wazir of the Sultan."},

    "description":"A very popular instrument in Iran, the chang is an angular harp, usually compromising of 24 strings that are played with the fingernails of both hands. The chords are secured using ropes, as can be seen in this rendition with some of the ropes sticking out from the base of the soundbox, which is usually covered in skin and can be seen here having a beautiful, almost floral pattern stretching from top to bottom. (Shayestehfar 2002, 8). This type of instrument, the chordophone, is known as the most complete among the external instruments that were popular in the Timurid era. We also see two men holding daffs, as an accompanying instrument. The daff is known to be a secondary instrument in other paintings as well (Shayestehfar 2002, 8).\n Instruments are common among depictions of royalty and luxury. In addition to food, flowers, wine, dancers and the sort, artists use musical instruments to make their paintings as close to a scene from heaven as possible, by trying to fulfill as many of the human desires as possible (Gholipour 2016, 4). Given that this is the court of a Sultan, there is a certain sense of formality that must be portrayed. Thus, we do not find any dancers nor any food, to not give off the impression of a party but also establish the extravagance of the court of Ibrahim Sultan."},

    "description":"Most buildings from the Timurid period are varying shades of blue, featuring meticulous tilework and religious calligraphy on the top. In the pillar of the court painted here, though, the artist chose to paint it a very dull and plain red. We do see some signature Timurid elements at the very top of the pillar in the form of the geometric patterns, but nothing too evident or protruding. This is intentionally done by the artist to not draw too much attention away from Sultan Ibrahim, while also allowing the pillar to retain its spatial significance (Hillenbrand 1992, 6). Had the pillar been more ornamented and detailed, the painting may have seemed excessively ‘busy’. But then how does the artist use the palace to show off the Sultan’s luxury?\nHe takes the subtle route by choosing to paint the pillar from the bottom to the top of the entire page and drawing it in 3D while keeping the rest of the entities of the building in 2D. Timurid paintings incorporate the flow of time through space by adding multiple people doing different things so as the viewer scans their eyes across the painting, it seem like people are doing different things at different times. By extending the pillar throughout these different activities, the artist subtly enforces Ibrahim Sultan’s magnificence through a seemingly insignificant pillar."},

    "description":"Adorned in his gold-colored shawl and red robe boasting a distinctive gold pattern, Ibrahim Sultan is seated comfortably in the middle of a luxurious gold carpet, while everyone must stand together in a tight crowd. He is placed in the centre of the folio so not only is he more prominent that way, but by scattering foliage and other entities like his ministers and musicians, the illustrator tries to slow down the viewer’s eyes while they examine the folio. This is done as a means to build up suspense leading up to the grand reveal, the patron of the manuscript (Hillenbrand 1992, 6). The Sultan wears his own uniquely styled crown, in contrast with everyone else’s turbans.\nMoreover, he can be seen sitting under a red parasol which is a unique way of highlighting royalty in Shirazi art from that period. Originally from 14th century paintings of Mongol princes, it quickly became a means for Timurid kings to stress their lineage to Timur and thus bolster their authority (Blair 1996, 2).Examining the posture of Ibrahim Sultan, he is seated cross-legged with one leg resting and the other upright, with his hand extended as he addresses his court. Holding this posture allows him to exude a calm yet intimidating demeanor."},

    "description":"The crockery portrayed is white, covered with designs of blue. These are very likely wine containers for the Sultan’s pleasure. Upon closer inspection, we can make out a dragon-like design on the left container, whilst the one on the right has some sort of creature that bears a resemblance to a peacock. This blue on white porcelain style originated from China and spread with the conquests of the Mongols (Golombek 2001, 5). This design language was quickly adopted by potters in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as they learned to make it themselves by imitating crafts that were imported from the Chinese region. Some craftsmen chose to imitate older imports instead of new ones and in doing so pottery began to be made that had both old and new Chinese elements.\nFast forward to the mid-1500s and craftsmen all over the Timurid empire were producing such crockery for both royalty and commonfolk alike. The princes at the time were avid collectors of Chinese porcelain and this trend continued into the Safavid era (Golombek 2001, 5). In this case, we can also see a third container unlike the other two, made of gold, showing Ibrahim Sultan had a diverse taste in the sort of crafts that he collected."},
